3. Build a simulation  of a distribution with a knowed expected value that: 
Given a random variable Y with a expected value &mu;, consider the function $g(x) = E((Y - x)^2)$
Simulate and plot a function g reaches its minimum value when  x = &mu; and it's minimum is  V(Y).

Y follows a Bernoulli distribution with parameters p = 0.5 ( which is a binomial distribution with n = 1) 



4. A person flips a fair coin, independently, until heads appear for the first time.
 If heads appears on the n-th toss, the person wins $2^n$ pesos.
 Let X be the person's winnings. This problem is known as the St. Petersburg paradox.
 Simulate to show that the expected profit is infinit.
