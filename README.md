# Statistical inference

3. Build a simulation  of a distribution with a knowed expected value that: 
Given a random variable Y with a expected value &mu;, consider the function $g(x) = E((Y - x)^2)$
Simulate and plot a function g reaches its minimum value when  x = &mu; and it's minimum is  V(Y).


4. A person flips a fair coin, independently, until heads appear for the first time.
 If heads appears on the n-th toss, the person wins $2^n$ pesos.
 Let X be the person's winnings. This problem is known as the St. Petersburg paradox.
 Simulate to show that the expected profit is infinit.

6. $Xn ~ N(0,1) \forall n=1,2, \ldots $
$$
`\overline{x}` = sum(X)/n
$$
 Plot $\overline{n}$ as function of n, from 1 to 1000.
